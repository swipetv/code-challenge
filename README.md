Code challenge for intern-developers wanting to join the [SwipeTV](http://www.swipetv.com/ "SwipeTV") team.

Hi Coder!
==============

This is where we invite you to solve a small code challenge to test your skills.
For us it is important to understand your current ability and the way you would solve these problems.
This will give us some insight into your current level of experience. 


### Up for a challlenge?

1 Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production.
2 Spend as much time as you like on this project. However, out of respect for your time, if you need to scope it to 3-4 hours, feel free to mock/fake any feature that you don't have time to develop.
3 The UX/UI is totally up to you. Feel free to explain any assumptions you have to make. If you like, get creative and add additional features a user might find useful!
4 While visual design is not part of the challenge, a polished interface is preferred.
